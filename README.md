### Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀

**Short Description:**
I make things that work.

**Long Description:**
I've always been a maker and a learner. With a love for problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and boundless creativity, I embarked on my journey as an artist in 2007. With a love of problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, boundless creativity, and a great deal of non-productive student loans, I began my career as a software engineer in 2022.  

In my coding endeavors, I'm on a quest for beautiful, satisfying solutions. The thrill of encountering a new problem, navigating the unknown, discovering a solution, and then optimizing it to the max is what keeps me going. Currently proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, and React, I'm on the path to practical mastery.

**Collaboration and Problem-Solving Enthusiast!** 🤝💡
